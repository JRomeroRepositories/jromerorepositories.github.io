### Mission
We are dedicated to forging the future of light hygiene technology - focusing on user-friendly and effective tools to support mental well-being.

### Vision
We strive to be the catalyst for a world where light hygiene is universally embraced as fundamental to mental health. We are committed to spearheading light hygiene innovation globally; fostering community, well-being, and empowering people to enjoy sustained vitality and balance - even through the darkest winters.

### Problem Space
Did you know that external factors such as temperature and movement can significantly impact human physiology? A variety of external factors can influence our physiology and, by extension, our experience. One of the most critical external cues for regulating the body's internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, is the nascently understood non-visual light cues in the eye. 

Modern lifestyles are characterized by plenty of indoor living, especially during colder winters. Unfortunately, this common lifestyle can often prevent desirable exposure to natural light and bring plenty of undesirable exposure to artificial light. It's important to note that the source of the light is less relevant to our bodies than the characteristics of the light we experience.

Recent research shows that irregular exposure to natural light can lead to various troublesome symptoms. This disruption is often more severe in regions with shorter daylight hours, especially during the winter months. 

*Depending on the nature of the disruption, two afflictions may arise:*

  - **Winter fatigue** is a condition that can be characterized by a low mood, lack of energy, increased lethargy, and an unexpected desire for more sleep. This condition is usually caused by a lack of natural light early in the day, which disrupts the body's internal clock and prevents it from resynchronizing to the external environment through morning daylight exposure.
  - **Social jetlag** is the phenomenon characterized by a misalignment between an individual's biological clock and their social schedules, like school and work obligations. When this misalignment persists, it can lead to irregular sleep patterns and various related health issues. Social jetlag is often exacerbated by exposure to artificial light sources, such as smartphone screens, during the evening and night.

The reduction in daylight during winter can affect the body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, exacerbating feelings of tiredness and contributing to winter fatigue. Additionally, the mismatch between natural light cycles and social obligations can lead to social jetlag, resulting in chronic sleep deprivation and its associated risks, including mood disorders and metabolic dysfunction.

As humans, our relationship with light is essential - it can invigorate us and give us energy, just as it can make us feel jetlagged and out of sync.
Imagine if we could embrace natural and artificial light in a way that supports our innate rhythms and enhances our well-being...

### The Solution
The solution is to implement good habits and practices with respect to both natural and artificial environmental light. The the collection of these practices and habits is called **Light Hygiene**

Good light hygiene can boost your energy levels and improve your overall well-being. It involves being mindful of the quality and quantity of light you receive and how it affects your body's natural rhythms. By prioritizing exposure to natural daylight and reducing unintentional exposure to artificial light, you can positively impact your sleep, mood, and productivity. 

Taking simple steps to improve your light hygiene can significantly impact your well-being. However, with the help of technological tools, achieving optimal light hygiene can be even easier and more convenient.

Here are some tips to improve your light hygiene:

  - Prioritize exposure to natural light during the early hours of the day to help synchronize your body's internal clock.
  - Limit exposure to blue light from screens in the evening to encourage better sleep quality and reduce social jetlag.
  - Use light technology such as therapy lights and smart lighting systems methodically and purposefully.

Integrating these practices can significantly improve an individual's well-bein and help them achieve a state of energized alertness - even in the depths of winter. Good light hygiene, therefore, represents a bridge between our innate biological rhythms and the modern, often indoor-centered lifestyle, offering a practical path to mitigating the negative physiological phenomena described in the problem space above.

## Project Update
SunSim is focused on developing the world's first software tool for attaining and maintaining great light hygiene - The SunSim Circadian mobile app. 

We are currently conducting a survey for the students of the University of Waterloo to gather information about their experiences during the winter season. The purpose of this survey is to identify ways we can help students, as their irregular schedules often disturb their biological rhythms.The survey is being conducted in-person at different locations around the Waterloo campus.

#### SunSim Circadian

The SunSum Circadian app is an innovative mobile application designed to help users combat winter fatigue and social jetlag by optimizing their exposure to ambient light. 
The app utilizes your smartphone's sensors to measure ambient light, collects other information about your sleep and social habits, and then provides personalized light exposure routines tailored to the user's preferences. It also accounts for geographical location, considering the availability of natural light, to ensure the routine is truly practicable. Interactive survey prompts continuously refine recommendations over time and integrate educational content on light hygiene benefits.

SunSim's proprietary comprehensive approach addresses winter fatigue and social jetlag with research-backed light management strategies.

#### SunSim UW Student Survey
UW SunSim Survey aims to validate the Canadian university students as an early adopter segment for technical solutions addressing winter fatigue. The survey seeks to understand the prevalence and impact of winter fatigue among university students, their awareness and engagement with solutions, and their openness to adopting technological aids for enhancing light hygiene.
