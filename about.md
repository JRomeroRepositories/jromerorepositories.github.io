### ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
Iâ€™m a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Honours Science and Business with minors in Physics and Economics. Iâ€™m a maker at heart, with a deep curiosity for how things function and the colourful applications that can be drawn thereof; from circuit boards and embedded systems to data pipelines and predictive models, I'm keen on solving real problems with tools that make you say - neato:)

Iâ€™m currently focused on Firebird, a machine-learning project that forecasts wildfire incidence to support resource allocation and environmental protection across Canada and beyond. The project blends my love for data applications, environmental stewardship, and solving real-world problems at scale. 

My dream is to build something impactful through technology and Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities at small, high-energy startups where I can do just that.

### ðŸš€ What I Bring
A cross-disciplinary mindset â€“ I thrive at the intersection of science, business, and tech, and bring experience in data science, project management, and strategic planning.
Startup energy â€“ For my final co-op term at UW, I took part in the Conrad school's entrepreneurship co-op program as a self-driven solo-preneur. This is where I built and validated a business from scratch (SunSim Technologies). I learned how to pivot, iterate fast, and learn on the go. I also developed an ardent love for entrepreneurship as a practice to bridge new ideas to old problems.
Project management chops â€“ I recently earned my CAPM designation from the PMI, and love keeping teams aligned and goals sharp.
Technical curiosity â€“ Whether itâ€™s ML  data pipelines, embedded electronics, or even mobile dev; Iâ€™ve always got a side project going and love getting my hands dirty with new tools and ideas.
People-first approach â€“ With strong communication skills and experience in customer-facing roles (including sales and strategic planning), Iâ€™m comfortable and familiar with a wide range of business aspects from the nitty gritty of data pipelines to the exciting subtleties of pitching a vision.

### ðŸŒ± Looking Ahead
Iâ€™m looking to grow with a team that shares my values: mission-driven, collaborative, and unafraid to tackle big challenges. Iâ€™d love to join a startup where I can contribute to product development, communications strategy, and/or technical project execution. Ideally, in a role that integrates hands-on development with big-picture problem-solving.

Letâ€™s connect! If youâ€™re building something exciting and need a smart, driven generalist who learns fast and builds with purpose, I'm your guy.
